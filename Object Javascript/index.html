        <h1>Exercise: Javascript Object</h1>
        <pre><a href="rectangle.html">1)Make a Rectangle class that stores a width and a height. Make a few instances and print out the
        properties. Modify a few of the properties and print out the results again.</a></pre>

        <pre><a href="prototype.html">2)Add a getArea method. Use the prototype property.</a></pre>

        <pre><a href="constructor_rect.html">3)Assuming that the Rectangle constructor takes a width and a height, why does the following output
        20 instead of 200? (Hint: if you see an answer that seems too obvious to be what I am looking for,
        it probably is the answer I am looking for.)</a>
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(4, 5);
        r.hieght = 50;
        r.getArea(); --> 20 // Not 200</pre>

        <pre><a href="object_js.html">4)Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and lastName properties, but don’t define
        a Person class first. Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name.</a>
5)Try reading the middleName property from your variable above. Try assigning to the middleName
property. Try reading the property again after you assign to it. Is this behavior a good thing or a bad thing?</pre>   

        <pre><a href="string-object.html">6)Create a string that contains what looks like an object with firstName and lastName properties. Use
        “eval” to turn it into a real object, and test it the same way you did with the previous object that you
        created directly.</a></pre>
     
        <pre><a href="json.html">7)Do the same with JSON.parse. You have to follow strict JSON rules in this case.</a></pre>

        <pre><a href="assign1.html">1)Write a JS program to create object of person with fields</a></pre>

        <pre><a href="assign2.html">2)Modify the above program to create 2 objects, amitabh and abhishek, here abhishek has some
        common properties from amitabh, try to use it such common properties from amitabh instead of
        creating it in abhishek.</a></pre>

        <pre><a href="assign3.html">3)Modify the above code to create third object as "Aaradhya", this object shares the common
            properties from amitabh as well as abhishek accordingly demostrate on your own.</a></pre>
